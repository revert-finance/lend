# revert lendoor

This repository contains the smart contracts for revert lendoor modules.

It uses Foundry as development toolchain.


## Setup

Install foundry 

https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

Install dependencies

```sh
forge install
```


## Tests

Most tests use a forked state of Ethereum Mainnet. You can run all tests with: 

```sh
forge test
```


Because the v3-periphery library (Solidity v0.8 branch) in PoolAddress.sol has a different POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH than the one deployed on Mainnet this needs to be changed for the integration tests to work properly.

bytes32 internal constant POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH = 0xa598dd2fba360510c5a8f02f44423a4468e902df5857dbce3ca162a43a3a31ff;

needs to be changed to 

bytes32 internal constant POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH = 0xe34f199b19b2b4f47f68442619d555527d244f78a3297ea89325f843f87b8b54;
